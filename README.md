# Summarization with Pointer Generator Networks
Python3 PyTorch implementation and [stanfordnlp/stanza]([https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza]) of Pointer-Generator Networks for Abstractive Summarization by See et. al.

Integration with Stanza, Stanford NLP's open-source library for many human languages. Load your own custom embeddings and use our Character Language Model embeddings for this task! 

This code is a Stanza-integrated version of [Atul Kumar's implementation]([url](https://github.com/atulkum/pointer_summarizer)) of the paper [Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks]([url](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04368))
